                <p>Hunting Kiwis is a favourite New Zealand past time but few tourists get to experience it. Normally you're restricted to seeing them in zoos. Travel with us to the beautiful Aroha Island and you'll get to see Kiwis in the wild and murder
                    them in cold blood! Their meat is a New Zealand delicacy and you can eat it roasted or Kentucky fried. Impress your friends and family with Facebook photos of you chowing down on a Kiwi you killed yourself!</p>

                <p>Live with the natives! The Maori people of New Zealand have a culture completely unchanged by Western influence. Stay in a traditional Maori <i>Pa</i>, hunt with a <i>Powehnua</i> and perform the world-renowned Haka! Te Wairoa in Rotorua
                    offers an experience available nowhere else. Say goodbye to wi-fi and hello to Te Reo! Give up your modern luxuries for one night and enter a culture rich with tradition. The Maori people will welcome you as one of their own and teach
                    you their traditional ways, allowing you to step outside of your Western mindset and see the world in a new way. Free moko with every stay.</p>

                <p>If you're not brave enough for Maori culture, you can always stay with New Zealand's other native people, the Hobbits! They are peaceful people who live inside of hills in their town of Hobbiton, which you probably recognise from the world-renowned
                    documentary Lord of the Rings. Dragon attacks now down by 60%! Enjoy a complementary second breakfast prepared by the Hobbits themselves.</p>

                <p>A favourite pasttime in New Zealand is betting on Moa racing. Moa are a flightless bird native to New Zealand and they are huge. When chased by their natural predator, Haast's Eagle, they run faster than you'd expect. New Zealanders have
                    found a way to engineer this scenario and they bet on the fastest Moa. Yet this vital part of Kiwi life is often overlooked by tourist companies because they think tourists will find it "cruel and unusual." But you're not a pansy,
                    so come with us to Honeycomb Hill Cave and have the time of your life drinking Lion Red and making some money on the Moa races!</p>

                <p>You've heard of La Tomatina, the festival in Spain where they throw tomatoes at each other. New Zealand has its own version, known as Nga Huakiwi, where they pelt each other with kiwfruit. Normally visitors are not allowed to partake in
                    the festival, but when you travel with us we'll get you down to Invercargill right in the middle of the action! Watch out though, kiwfruit are not quite as squishy as tomatoes.</p>

            <div class="col-6">
                <p>Once all the kiwfruit have been cleaned up, it's time for the next stage of festivities. The annual running of the sheep. This is completely different from the running of the bulls, insofar as you risk getting trampled instead of gored.
                    This is not for the feint hearted, and if you can't run fast then this is not for you. But for the adrenaline junkie this is as good as it gets. The streets are packed full of sheep so the slightest slip up means getting trampled as
                    you try to outpace a herd of very confused sheep. Even if you're not man enough to participate, it is a sight to behold and recommended to all of our clients.</p>
